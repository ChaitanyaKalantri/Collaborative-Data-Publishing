# Collaborative-Data-Publishing

## Introduction
During the final year of engineering, I developed an interest in ***Data Science*** and ***Cryptography***. Me and
a classmate worked on implementing an IEEE paper named ` ‘m-Privacy for Collaborative Data
Publishing’ ` under the tutelage of Prof.Varsha Gaikwad [https://www.linkedin.com/in/varsha-gaikwad-b749a11b/], 
the Head of Department of the Information Technology branch. 


## Implementation
- The project was designed using ***Java swing*** front-end with ***Oracle*** database at the backend and developed
using ***net-beans*** IDE. 
- I created a new algorithm fusing an existing algorithm from the IEEE paper ‘m-
Privacy for Collaborative Data Publishing‘, with k-nearest neighbour algorithm to improve the security of the patient’s details. 

## Outcome
- The results were displayed in ***graphical*** and ***tabular*** form to make them easy to understand. 
- The application was intended for use by ***local health bodies*** to prevent the spread of diseases. 
- Moreover, received ***A*** grade in the respective subject as well.

## Paper Published
- Also published a paper ‘Collaborative Data Publishing Technique Using Privacy Preserving Technique’ related to the project, 
at an International conference on 3rd April 2016, named ***IFERP***(Institution for Engineering Research and Publications).

- Received ***‘Best Paper’*** award for the most innovative and implementable idea.
